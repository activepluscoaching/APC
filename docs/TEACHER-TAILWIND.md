# Teacher panel on Tailwind (2026-10-21)

The teacher panel (`teacher.html`) is styled by one Tailwind build,
`css/teacher-panel.css`. The old 1,300-line inline `<style>` block is gone; the
page now links the compiled sheet after the canonical fifteen stylesheets.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `tailwind.config.cjs` | The build config. Teacher-only content paths, preflight off, `important: '.teacher-reference'`, palette tokens as theme colours. |
| `css/tailwind/teacher.src.css` | The authored source: `@tailwind` layers, the teacher component layer (`@apply` + token-backed gradients/blur), and the deep-screen component rules. |
| `css/teacher-panel.css` | The compiled, minified sheet. **Committed**, because GitHub Pages serves static files with no build step. |
| `tests/teacher-panel-tailwind.test.mjs` | Locks the scope, the hero structure, and that the committed sheet equals a fresh build. |

## Build

```bash
npm run build:teacher-css     # tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.cjs -i css/tailwind/teacher.src.css -o css/teacher-panel.css --minify
```

Run it after editing `teacher.html`, `js/teacher.js` (render templates) or the
source sheet, and commit the regenerated `css/teacher-panel.css`.
`tests/teacher-panel-tailwind.test.mjs` fails when the committed file drifts
from the build.

## Scope guarantees

* `important: '.teacher-reference'` prefixes every utility with the body class
  only `teacher.html` carries, so the sheet cannot style the student, admin,
  manager or payment portals even if it were linked from them
  (`tests/panel-isolation.test.mjs` keeps that class on one page).
* `preflight: false`: the shared fifteen-sheet cascade keeps ownership of the
  global reset, typography, form font sizes and the shell geometry (430/520 px
  teacher shell, five dock seats).
* Every colour is a `css/foundation.css` token, so the light and AMOLED themes
  come from this single build — no second palette.

## Home hero

The owner asked (2026-10-21) for the hero to *be* the picture:

* no gradient card behind the artwork — `.teacher-home-intro` is the image
  window itself (`overflow: hidden`, `aspect-ratio: 16 / 10`,
  `min-height: var(--t-hero-min-h)`);
* the day/night classroom artwork fills it (`.teacher-hero-scene`, absolutely
  positioned, `object-fit: cover`);
* `স্বাগতম, <teacher name>` plus the daily advice line sit **inside** the picture
  as an in-flow overlay (`.teacher-hero-content`), over a bottom scrim built
  from the `--t-scrim-ink` token so the text stays readable on both the bright
  day scene and the night scene;
* layout of the overlay is written with Tailwind utilities in `teacher.html`
  (flex, gaps, sizes, `text-on-hero`); only gradients, blur, shadows and motion
  live in the component layer.

The identity initial, the day/night glint and the picture swap are still driven
by `js/teacher.js` (`#teacherHomeInitial`, `#teacherHeroGlint`, `#teacherHeroArt`).

## Artwork

`assets/teacher-hero/teacher-hero-day.webp` and `-night.webp` are a matched pair
(828 × 462, 16:10) that `js/teacher.js` swaps at 06:00 / 18:00 Asia/Dhaka.
**Neither illustration contains a sun or a moon** — the old day scene did, so it
showed two suns next to the day/night chip on the card. The chip
(`.teacher-hero-glint`, sun by day → moon by night) is the only celestial
marker; day is sky + clouds, night is stars + city glow. Replacement rules
(size, calm zones, palette) live in `assets/teacher-hero/README.md` and are
locked by `tests/teacher-panel-tailwind.test.mjs`.
